 Is there an efficient way to return the aggregate of the various drives on a Windows OS using Powershell? Instead of returning individual drives , I need to a total capacity .

Answer:This Powershell function accepts an input parameter of a server name. The script uses Get-Wmiobject method, to iterate though every disk – note: I have it filtered at DriveType=3 – you can change this to your specifications.

The script aggregates the disks and uses the $TotalCapacity variable, to return to the calling process. There is an example code to call the function.

Function GetAggDiskCapacity([string]$server)
{
$computer = $server
$disks = @(Get-WmiObject Win32_LogicalDisk -ComputerName $computer -Filter 'DriveType = 3')
 $TotalCapacity = 0
$disks | ForEach { $TotalCapacity += $_.Size }
return $TotalCapacity 
    
}
##example

##GetAggDiskCapacity myservername45
