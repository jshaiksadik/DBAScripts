I'm trying to send an email with multiple recipients in Powershell, and getting an exception  error message:

Exception calling "Add" with "1" argument(s): "An invalid character was found in the mail header: ';'."

When I revert to send the email to one recipient - the email is successfull . What is the correct way to pass multiple recipients for powershell email.

Some more information that may assist in troubleshooting.

1) When I hardcode the email addresses in the Powershell code  e.g $emailTo = "user1@org.com,user2@org.com"  it works ok . 

2)When I attempt to pass the values in as input parameters the errors are generated. 

param (
[Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
[string]$emailTo
)

$emailTo = "$emailTo"

An example of how I'm executing the script:

.\SQL_Server_Audit.ps1  -emailTo "user1@org.com;user2@org.com"   

 

Answer: Looking at the code examples you've posted, there are 2 separate issues. 

Issue 1 : the email separator. You've reported the message - Exception calling "Add" with "1" argument(s): "An invalid character was found in the mail header: ';'."

If you change the separator to "," it will work

issue 2 :   You're passing the multiple recipients   with doubles quotes  ""   , but this will throw an error. Change the double quotes to single quotes '' , and the issue will be fixed

In summary , when calling the powershell file it should be:

.\SQL_Server_Audit.ps1  -emailTo 'user1@org.com,user2@org.com'
